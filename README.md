# oneShot
here is a repository of projects I made in 1 night.

The sudoku project consist in an automated sudoku solver able to solve 70 sudokus per second no matter the difficulty
and solved 1,000,000 sudokus from a kaggle database in less than 4 hours with a success rate of 100%.
This project has been coded from scratch using the numpy library.

The carLearning project consist in a genetic approach to solve the self driving car problem. A demo video of a typical generation is also
visible in the project. The simulation runs at roughtly 70 frames per seconds using the pygame library to display it.
The collision detection system, the neural network creation the offspring generation, the physics engine and the display
of the race are coded from scratch using numpy and pygame libraries.
